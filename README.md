### General Description

Developed a data analysis and machine learning pipeline for binary classification
tasks on real-world datasets, including salary prediction and cerebrovascular accident
risk. Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis, identifying missing val-
ues, outliers, and attribute correlations. Applied data preprocessing techniques such
as imputation of missing/extreme values and standardization of numeric features. Im-
plemented and evaluated logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron models, re-
viewing performance via confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 met-
rics. Generated visualizations for feature distributions, class balance, and model perfor-
mance, demonstrating interpretability and robust model evaluation.
